To display the web app, simply open index.html in a web browser.

You may also run this on the simple Node.js web server provided: ``node nodewebserver.js``

Then go to http://localhost:3000/. ``nodewebserver.js`` should be placed where index.html, javascripts/, and stylesheets/ are located. It should, of course, work straight off of this repository.
